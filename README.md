# Coursework for "Unreal Engine Cinematic Creator: Video Game Design Course"

This repository contains the assets developed as part of the course [Unreal Engine Cinematic Creator: Video Game Design Course](https://www.gamedev.tv/p/unreal-cinematic).

The goal of this course is to use Unreal to:

* Create your own non-interactive cut scene which is triggered from gameplay.
* Compose interesting camera shots and animate your cameras as if you were Steven Spielberg's personal camera operator.
* Create movement and flavor in your levels by animating world events to take place as the player moves through your level.
* Create animation sequences and render them to movie format so that you can make your own short films if you so desired.
